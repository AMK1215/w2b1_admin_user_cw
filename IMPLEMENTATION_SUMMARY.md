# ShweDragon Admin Panel - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of admin panel with role-based access control for 3 user types: **Owner**, **Player**, and **SystemWallet**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
**NO AGENT SYSTEM**: This application does NOT have agents, sub-agents, or any agent hierarchy. The system only has:
- **Owner** (manages players)
- **Player** (belongs to owner)
- **SystemWallet** (system operations)

The database field `agent_id` is actually used as `owner_id` to maintain Owner->Player relationships.
